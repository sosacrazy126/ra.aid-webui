def run_interactive_command(cmd: List[str]) -> Tuple[bytes, int]:
    """
    Runs an interactive command with a pseudo-tty, capturing combined output.

    Assumptions and constraints:
    - We are on a Linux system with script available
    - `cmd` is a non-empty list where cmd[0] is the executable
    - The executable and script are assumed to be on PATH
    - If anything is amiss (e.g., command not found), we fail early and cleanly

    The output is cleaned to remove ANSI escape sequences and control characters.

    Returns:
